# space_invaders
space invaders implented in c using ncurses!\
This is more like a little toy project, to have fun with some C programming, and not really all that fun to play.\
If you are interested in a playable game implemented using ncurses check out my snake game.
## compile
```
gcc main.c -o out -lncurse && ./out
```
