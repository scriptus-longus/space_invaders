# space_invaders
space invaders implented in c using ncurses\\
this is more like a little toy project to have fun with some c programming, and not really all that fun to play.\\
If you are interested in a playable game implemented using ncurses check out my snake game.
## compile
'''
gcc main.c -o out -lncurse && ./out
